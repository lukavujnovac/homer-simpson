        Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12)[16] is the main protagonist and one of
        the five main characters of The Simpsons series. He is the spouse of
        Marge Simpson and father of Bart Simpson, Lisa Simpson, and Maggie
        Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often
        ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has
        shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares
        about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He serves as the main
        protagonist of the 2007 film adaptation.
